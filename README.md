# RevBots
 nwunder's discord bots
 
# Bulbe
 While Bulbe is intended for personal use, I've made the bot public. You can add Bulbe to your server [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=548178287013396532&scope=bot&permissions=68537409)

# Juandissimo
 This is the Juandissimo Fan Club's custom helper bot. He's designed to handle server management, moderation, and anything else that might be helpful in developing a bot.
 If interested in contributing, create a fork of this repository, make your edits there, then submit a pull request.
 I'll have a look and if it looks alright I'll add it to the bot!

# Using my code
 This code isn't intended to be easily shared and reused. I'd prefer people didn't run an instance of any of my bots. This code is public to allow people to contribute to Juandissimo, and for educational purposes. If interested in using one of my bots, feel free to invite Bulbe to your server.
